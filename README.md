# Auto-updates PaperMC projects

### Motivation

Paper has made it very difficult to auto update servers, because they discourage it. This means that you can't just request the latest version from their API.  
But then you see, yesterday a log4j vunl in minecraft allowed RCE.  
As long as you have a GOOD backup, IMO auto updates are fine.
